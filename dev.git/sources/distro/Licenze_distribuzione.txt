ICONV

The iconv program converts text from one encoding to another encoding. More precisely, it converts from the encoding given for the -f option to the encoding given for the -t option. Either of these encodings defaults to the encoding of the current locale. All the inputfiles are read and converted in turn; if no inputfile is given, the standard input is used. The converted text is printed to standard output.
