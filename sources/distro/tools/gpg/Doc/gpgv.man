NAME
       gpgv - Verify OpenPGP signatures

SYNOPSIS
       gpgv [options] signed_files





DESCRIPTION
       gpgv is an OpenPGP signature verification tool.

       This  program  is actually a stripped down version of gpg which is only
       able to check signatures. It is somewhat smaller than the  fully  blown
       gpg  and  uses  a  different (and simpler) way to check that the public
       keys used to make the signature are valid. There are  no  configuration
       files and only a few options are implemented.

       gpgv  assumes that all keys in the keyring are trustworthy.  By default
       it uses a keyring named `trustedkeys.gpg' which is assumed to be in the
       home  directory  as defined by GnuPG or set by an option or an environ-
       ment variable. An option may be used to specify another keyring or even
       multiple keyrings.



RETURN VALUE
       The  program returns 0 if everything was fine, 1 if at least one signa-
       ture was bad, and other error codes for fatal errors.


OPTIONS
       gpgv recognizes these options:



       --verbose

       -v     Gives more information during processing.  If  used  twice,  the
              input data is listed in detail.


       --quiet

       -q     Try to be as quiet as possible.


       --keyring file
              Add  file  to the list of keyrings.  If file begins with a tilde
              and a slash, these are replaced by the HOME  directory.  If  the
              filename  does  not  contain a slash, it is assumed to be in the
              home-directory ("~/.gnupg" if --homedir is not used).


       --status-fd n
              Write special status strings to the file descriptor n.  See  the
              file DETAILS in the documentation for a listing of them.


       --logger-fd n
              Write log output to file descriptor n and not to stderr.


       --ignore-time-conflict
              GnuPG  normally  checks that the timestamps associated with keys
              and signatures have plausible values. However, sometimes a  sig-
              nature  seems  to  be  older than the key due to clock problems.
              This option turns these checks into warnings.


       --homedir dir
              Set the name of the home directory to dir. If his option is  not
              used,  the  home  directory  defaults to `~/.gnupg'.  It is only
              recognized when given on the command line.   It  also  overrides
              any  home  directory  stated  through  the  environment variable
              `GNUPGHOME' or (on W32 systems) by means on the  Registry  entry
              HKCU\Software\GNU\GnuPG:HomeDir.



EXAMPLES
       gpgv pgpfile

       gpgv sigfile
              Verify  the  signature  of the file. The second form is used for
              detached signatures, where sigfile  is  the  detached  signature
              (either  ASCII  armored  or  binary) and are the signed data; if
              this is not given the name of the file holding the  signed  data
              is  constructed  by cutting off the extension (".asc", ".sig" or
              ".sign") from sigfile.



FILES
       ~/.gnupg/trustedkeys.gpg
              The default keyring with the allowed keys



ENVIRONMENT
       HOME   Used to locate the default home directory.


       GNUPGHOME
              If set directory used instead of "~/.gnupg".

       command
